# PocketPollster
Back in 2005 I wanted to teach myself C#.NET.  I found that I learn much better when I'm building something tangible rather than just reading documentation.  So I set about to build from scratch an application that consisted of 3 parts:
1. A WinForms desktop app on which mobile forms would be designed, deployed, and the captured data later analyzed.
2. A Windows Mobile app that would [back then] run on "Pocket PC" devices, such as those made by HP, Dell, & Casio.
3. A Data Transfer utility that also ran as an app on the Windows computer.

For a more detailed explanation please read [this document](Docs/PP_AlphaTutorial.doc)

I've decided to publish this code publicly because I think it is a good representation of my work back then.  Forgive the fact that there are no tests at all but back then I simply didn't know about such practices!

Given the fact that it's almost 2020, I'm amazed that so many organizations still user paper forms.
